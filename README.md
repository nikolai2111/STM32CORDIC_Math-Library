## 2. Description
This library implements some basic math functions like the libm, but specialised for the STM32 CORDIC coprocessor in the STM32G4 or STM32U5 series.

I like the STM32G474 because of its versatility and its hardware integrated into the MCU. FreeRTOS is also a very versatile kernel that I also like for its simplicity. So I combined the two in one template. This way I don't have to copy and paste the project or files.

## 3. Usage
To make optimal use of this repository, it is easiest to fork this [repository](https://github.com/nikolai2111/STM32G474_FreeRTOS_Template). You can then use the repository as a template for other projects on GitHub. To do this, you can simply select it from the repository template drop-down when you create a new repository.
